* Add support for more drivers to shgen !!!!

* shgen relies on having a gnu-compatible getopt, which should be
  available on all hosts using gcc/egcs/binutils. 
  Using other getopt-variants may produce faulty results or shgen may also
  refuse to compile. Probably the easiest solution to this problem would be 
  to integrate libiberty into rtems.

* shgen uses floating point mathematics. Therefore Makefile.in contains a 
  reference to libm. In case the host doesn't have its floating point
  support in libm, shgen will fail to compile. If we should ever meet such 
  a host, checks for floating point libraries have to be added to rtems'
  autoconf support.
