This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  sp65

directives:

  rtems_semaphore_create
  rtems_semaphore_obtain

concepts:

+ Verify that obtaining a priority ceiling mutex when the calling task's
  priority is the same as the priority ceiling is handled correctly.

+ Verify the priority ceiling mutex getting released which results in a thread
  being unblocked and the unblocked thread's priority being elevated.

+ Verify that an initially locked priority ceiling mutex elevates the priority
  of the creating task.
