This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  sp51

directives:

  rtems_semaphore_create
  rtems_semaphore_obtain
  rtems_semaphore_mutex

concepts:

+ Ensure that obtaining a binary semaphore with priority ceiling enabled
  properly detects a ceiling violation when there is no conflict.

+ Ensure the when the binary semaphore lock fails to acquire the mutex,
  it is an error to release it since the lock failed.

+ Verify that creation of an initially locked priority inheritance mutex does
  not change the priority of the executing thread.
