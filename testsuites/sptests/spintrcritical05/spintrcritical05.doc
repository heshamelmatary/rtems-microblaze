This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  spintrcritical05

directives:

  _Thread_queue_Enqueue_priorithy
  _Thread_queue_Dequeue_priorithy
    - interrupt synchronization

concepts:

+ Ensure that unblocking a task from an ISR while the task is in the process
  of blocking on a thread queue works as expected.  This test adds the
  variation that the blocking task is of a priority that requires a reverse
  search.
