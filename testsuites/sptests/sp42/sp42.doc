This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  sp42

directives:

  rtems_semaphore_create
  rtems_semaphore_obtain
  rtems_semaphore_release
  rtems_semaphore_delete
  rtems_task_create
  rtems_task_delete
  rtems_task_start
  really exercising various Thread Queue capabilities:
    _Thread_queue_Enqueue_FIFO
    _Thread_queue_Enqueue_priority
    _Thread_queue_Dequeue_FIFO
    _Thread_queue_Dequeue_priority

concepts:

+ This test is very carefully constructed to exercise the data structure
  used to implement the priority blocking chains in the Thread Queue. The
  task priorities used force forward and reverse searches and use of the
  2-n chains
+ This test also ensures that the dequeues are performed in the correct
  order.
