This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: sptls03

directives:

  - _Thread_Initialize()

concepts:

  - Ensure that the thread-local storage (TLS) is not allocated if TLS is not
    used.
  - Ensure that the small-data variables are accessible.  On some architectures
    like PowerPC the TLS ABI conflicts with other variants.
