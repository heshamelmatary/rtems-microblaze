This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  spedfsched01

directives:
  + rtems_task_create
  + rtems_task_start
  + rtems_task_delete
  + rtems_task_indent
  + rtems_task_get_tod
  + rtems_task_wake_after

concepts:

This test is identical to sp01 but for EDF-based scheduling:

  a.  Verifies system can create and start both the executive's system
      initialization and idle task.

  b.  Verifies executive can swap between three application tasks at the
      same priority and the executive's internal idle task.

  c.  Verifies can print strings to the CRT on port 2 of the mvme136 board
      using Print and Println in the board support package.

  d.  Verifies interrupt handler can handle a task switch from an interrupt.

  e.  Verifies executive initialization performed correctly.

  f.  Verifies the executive trap handler except for the halt function.

  g.  Verifies that a task can get the task identification number of itself.

  h.  Verifies implementation of SuperCore TOD_MILLISECONDS_TO_TICKS.  Normal
      computation in applications is via a macro at the Classic API level.

output:
 "TA1" is printed once every 5 seconds.  "TA2" is printed once
 every 10 seconds.  "TA3" is printed once every 15 seconds.
