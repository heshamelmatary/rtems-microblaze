This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  test4

directives:
  rtems_task_create
  rtems_task_start
  rtems_task_mode
  rtems_clock_set
  rtems_clock_get
  rtems_event_receive
  rtems_extension_create
  rtems_extension_delete

concepts:

  a.  Verifies timeslicing ( all tasks are in timeslice mode ).

  b.  Verifies the tswitch user extension.

  c.  Verifies the no preemption mode.

  d.  Verifies time-slice gets reset even if only one task ready.

  e.  Verifies that deleting a user extension with a task switch hook
      works as expected.

output:
  The task name and the current time are printed out each time that a new
  task is being dispatched.  The configured timeslice is 100 ticks
  ( 1 second ); therefore, a task name and the time are printed once
  every second.  After each task runs 3 times, task 1 changes its mode to
  no preempt and runs for about 6 seconds and then changes its mode back to
  preempt mode.
