This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

Configuration:

Pipes not enabled.

Expected:

With pipes not enabled, the semaphore required for creation of new
pipe will not be available (this semaphore is created at init if pipes
are enabled)

With this, fifo_open fails with EINTR
