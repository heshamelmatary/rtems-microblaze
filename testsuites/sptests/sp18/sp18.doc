This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  sp18

directives:

  rtems_task_create
  really allocation failures in _Thread_Initialize

concepts:

+ Ensure that all memory is freed when some part of the task allocation
  fails.  We start with a stack size that consumes all memory and work
  down a bit at a time until the task create is successful.  This is designed
  to hit all cases.
