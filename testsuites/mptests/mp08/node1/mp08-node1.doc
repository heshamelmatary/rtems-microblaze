GLOBAL SEMAPHORE TEST

directives:
  ex_init, ex_start, t_create, t_start, tm_tick, i_return, t_ident,
  sm_create, sm_ident, sm_p, sm_v, sm_delete

concepts:

  a.  Verifies system can create and start both the executive's system
      initialization and idle task.

  b.  Verifies executive can swap between three application tasks at the
      same priority and the executive's internal idle task.

  c.  Verifies can print strings to the CRT on port 2 of the mvme136 board
      using Print and Println in the board support package.

  d.  Verifies interrupt handler can handler a task switch from an interrupt
      as specified with the i_return directive.

  e.  Verifies executive initialization performed correctly.

  f.  Verifies the executive trap handler except for the halt function.

  g.  Verifies that a task can get the identification number of
      a global sempahore.

  h.  Verifies that two tasks on different processors can
      alternate accessing a semaphore.

  i.  Verifies operation of sm_delete on global semaphores
      for both normal and error case.

  j.  Verifies Rpc and Process_pkt for packet types Q_SMP, Q_SMV,
      P_OBJCREATE (semaphore), P_OBJDELETE (semaphore), P_SMDEL_TQ.
