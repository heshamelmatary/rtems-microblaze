= Message Latency Benchmark

This benchmark measures the intertask message latency. This is the delay within
RTEMS between a running task using the rtems_message_queue to send a message to
a waiting task and that task waking up and receiving the message.

== Methodology

This benchmark consists of a high priority task and a low priority task. The
benchmark starts in the high priority task, which blocks on a call to rtems_
message_queue recieve. By accounting for the overhead of the task switch from
the high priority task to the low priority task, and the actual time to recieve
the message, the intertask message latency is found.

The average is found and the overhead (the time of the first run) is subtracted
out in the call to put_time.
