This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  psximfs01

directives:

  + open
  + close
  + read
  + write
  + lseek
  + ftruncate
  + unlink

concepts:

+ Create an IMFS instance with the smallest possible block size.  This
ensures the maximum file size is relatively small.

+ Create, write, and read a file of maximum size.

+ Use ftruncate to shorten the file from the maximum size to 0.

+ This should exercise much of the singly, doubly and triply indirect
block management code in the IMFS.

+ Exercise unlink, and hence IMFS_memfile_remove
