This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name:  psxsignal05

directives:

  sigemptyset
  sigaddset
  sigwaitinfo

concepts:


+ Ensure if _POSIX_signals_Clear_signals is called to clear a process wide
  SA_SIGINFO signal which is pending but there is not a queued SA_SIGINFO 
  structure, then things happen correctly.

NOTE: This case may be impossible to hit in real code but until that is
      proven we need to be defensive and protect against it.
