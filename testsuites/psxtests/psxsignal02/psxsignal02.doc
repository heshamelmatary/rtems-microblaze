test set name:  psxsignal02

directives:

  sigemptyset
  sigaddset
  pthread_sigmask
  sigaction
  pthread_attr_init
  pthread_setschedparam
  pthread_attr_setinheritsched

concepts:

+ Ensure the the algorithm in killinfo.c which decides which

NOTE:

+ The order of thread creation, priority and their action is
  very carefully chosen to force every path through killinfo.c.
