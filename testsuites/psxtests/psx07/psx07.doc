Concepts:
+ Verifies that pthread_attr_init and pthread_attr_destroy work as
expected with a variety of attributes, scopes, and schedulers

+ Ensures that pthread_create works as expected, and fails with a faulty
stacksize or inherit scheduler

+ Verifies that pthread_attr_setstackaddr works as expected

+ Verifies that pthread_attr_getcputime and pthread_attr_setcputime work
as expected with a variety of valid and invalid attributes and clocks

+ Verifies that pthread_attr_setinheritsched and
pthread_attr_getinheritsched work as expected with a variety of attributes
and schedules

+ Verifies that pthread_join works as expected

+ Verifies that pthead_attr_setscope and pthread_attr_getscope work as
expected with a variety of attributes and scopes

+ Verifies that pthread_attr_setschedpolicy and pthread_attr_getschedpolcy
work as expected with a variety of attributes and policies

+ Verifies that pthread_attr_setstacksize and pthread_attr_getstacksize
work as expected with a variety of stack sizes and attributes

+ Verifies that pthread_attr_setstackaddr and pthread_attr_getstackaddr
work as expected with a variety of attributes and stacks

+ Verifies that pthread_attr_setdetachstate and
pthread_attr_getdetachstate work as expected with a variety of attributes
and states

+ Verifies that pthread_attr_setschedparam and pthread_attr_getschedparam
work as expected with a variety of attributes, threads, priorities,
schedules, replenish periods, budgets, and policies

+ Verifies that usleep works as expected when executed by a child thread
