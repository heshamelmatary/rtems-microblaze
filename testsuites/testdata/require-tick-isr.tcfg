#
# These tests require that the BSP have a real clock tick ISR. Some
# simulator BSPs do not have any interrupt sources and use the file
# libbsp/shared/clock_driver_simidle.c.
#
# Tests which do not work with this clock driver tend to have the
# one of the following characteristics:
#
#  + Assume that a clock tick will occur while a task is running
#    continuously can be
#  + Assume that a timer service routine will execute in an ISR
#    while a task is running continously.
#  + Has a busy spin loop waiting to start the test on a tick boundary
#    does this.
#
# Eventually there should be a way to note that a BSP has a list
# of expected test failures which are specific to it AND a set of
# characteristics that make running classes of test appropriate or
# inappropriate. At that point, this would be one characteristic.
#
# NOTE: Each test in this list should be reviewed to ensure that it
#       has a legitimate reason to not run on a BSP with the simulator
#       clock idle task. It may need to be broken into multiple tests
#       if not executing it misses other paths.
