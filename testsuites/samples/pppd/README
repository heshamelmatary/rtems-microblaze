This is an example user application using pppd.  It is built using
the RTEMS application Makefiles.  The file Makefile-user should
be renamed to Makefile or the -f option given to make.  The file
is renamed to avoid bootstrap -c removing it.

The files ppp.conf and pppd.options are sample configuration files
that have successfully used to make ppp connections over a null
modem serial cable to a UNIX box.  Please review the man pages
for either the ppp or pppd applications to ensure they are configured
correctly.
