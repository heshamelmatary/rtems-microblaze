 *  for the RTEMS Workspace and C Program Heap.  Having separate pools
 *  does haved some advantages in the event a task blows a stack or writes
 *  outside its memory area. However, in low memory systems the overhead of
 *  the two pools plus the potential for unused memory in either pool is
 *  very undesirable.
 *
 *  In high memory environments, this is desirable when you want to use
 *  the RTEMS "unlimited" objects option.  You will be able to create objects
 *  until you run out of memory.
