This file describes the directives and concepts tested by this test set.

test set name: block06

Test 1: Get task 0 to get buffer 0 from the pool then release it twice.

Test 2: Get task 0 to get buffers 0 -> 4 from the pool hold them. Then get
        task 1 and task 2 to get them with blocking. The 2 tasks tests the
        priority blocking on the buffer.

Test 3: Read a block from disk into the buffer, modify the block and release
        it modified. Use a block great then 4 because 0 -> 4 are in the cache.

Test 4: Read every buffer in the pool and hold. Then get task 1 to ask for
        another buffer that is being accessed. It will block waiting for it to
		appear.
 
Test 5: Read every buffer in the pool and hold. Then get task 1 to ask for a
        new buffer. It will block waiting for one to appear.

Test 6: Get 5 buffers, release modify 4 then sync the last.

Test 7: Get 5 buffers, release modify them all then sync the device.

Test 8: Get 5 buffers, release modify the last 2 then the reset from 0.

TODO: if possible, break into separate tests
