 * MODULE DESCRIPTION:
 * This module implements the RTEMS drivers for the PC serial ports
 * as /dev/ttyS1 for COM1 and /dev/ttyS2 as COM2. If one of the ports
 * is used as the console, this driver would fail to initialize.
 *
 * This code was based on the console driver. It is based on the
 * current termios framework. This is just a shell around the
 * termios support.
