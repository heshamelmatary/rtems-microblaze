/*! @file
 * @brief Check how read/release work in case of only one buffer in ready list.
 *
 * Test sequence:
 * -# In thread #1 call rtems_bdbuf_get(#N) to get an empty block #N.
 * -# In thread #1 call rtems_bdbuf_release_modified() for previously 
 *    got buffer.
 * -# In thread #1 call rtems_bdbuf_read(#N) to get the same buffer
 *    (after this call a buffer is in AVL tree with ACCESS_MODIFIED state).
 * -# In thread #2 call rtems_bdbuf_read/get(#M).
 * -# In thread #1 call rtems_bdbuf_release(#N).
 * -# Check that in thread #2 a buffer is obtained.
