/*! @file
 * @brief Check how rtems_bdbuf_read() handles two readers waiting
 * for a buffer with the same block number in cases when disk device 
 * driver reports success in read complete notification.
 *
 * Test sequence:
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_read() function in thread #1 and block on
 *    waiting for read complete notification.
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_read() function in thread #2 for the same
 *    block number. As the result it blocks on this read as well
 *    (but it will block on transfer semaphore).
 * -# Disk device reports success in read complete notification.
 *    As the result rtems_bdbuf_read() function returns RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL
 *    in thread #1.
 * -# Thread #1 releases buffer with rtems_bdbuf_release() function.
 * -# rtems_bdbuf_read() function in thread #2 unlocks and 
 *    returns RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL.
 * -# Call rtems_bdbuf_release() function in thread #2.
 * .
