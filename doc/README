Tools Required
==============
The following tools are used in the production of this documentation:

TeX
texi2html 1.82
texinfo-tex 4.13a

texi2html will be deprecated in the upcomine texinfo release. At that point,
we will need to provide support for texi2any.pl as an alternative means to
produce html output.

This was used by the authors to generate the directory tree figure
in the texinfo printed version:

tree (from the CTAN Archives -- see http://jasper.ora.com/ctan.html)

Changing the Version Number and Timestamp
=========================================

RTEMS Version number is in configure.in.  Edit that file and run bootstrap.

Documentation date is in common/setup.texi.in and also must be modified
by hand.  bootstrap does not have to be run after modifying this file.

Making the Documentation
========================

cd rtems-XXX/doc
../bootstrap
./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
make all
make install

Cleaning
========

make clean
make distclean
make maintainer-clean

Making a Source Distribution
============================
This generates a rtems-<version>.tar.gz in the toplevel directory.

Making a Preformatted Distribution
==================================
Install and tar it up. :)
