@chapter Thread Manager

@section Introduction

The thread manager implements the functionality required of the thread
manager as defined by POSIX 1003.1b. This standard requires that
a compliant operating system provide the facilties to manage multiple
threads of control and defines the API that must be provided.

The services provided by the thread manager are:

@section Background

@subsection Thread Attributes

Thread attributes are utilized only at thread creation time. A thread
attribute structure may be initialized and passed as an argument to
the @code{pthread_create} routine.

@table @b
@item stack address
is the address of the optionally user specified stack area for this thread.
If this value is NULL, then RTEMS allocates the memory for the thread stack
from the RTEMS Workspace Area. Otherwise, this is the user specified
address for the memory to be used for the thread's stack. Each thread must
have a distinct stack area. Each processor family has different alignment
rules which should be followed.

@item stack size
is the minimum desired size for this thread's stack area.
If the size of this area as specified by the stack size attribute
is smaller than the minimum for this processor family and the stack
is not user specified, then RTEMS will automatically allocate a
stack of the minimum size for this processor family.

@item contention scope
specifies the scheduling contention scope. RTEMS only supports the
PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS scheduling contention scope.

@item scheduling inheritance
specifies whether a user specified or the scheduling policy and
parameters of the currently executing thread are to be used. When
this is PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED, then the scheduling policy and
parameters of the currently executing thread are inherited by
the newly created thread.

@item scheduling policy and parameters
specify the manner in which the thread will contend for the processor.
The scheduling parameters are interpreted based on the specified policy.
All policies utilize the thread priority parameter.

@subsection pthread_attr_init - Initialize a Thread Attribute Set

@findex pthread_attr_init
@cindex  initialize a thread attribute set

@subheading CALLING SEQUENCE:


@example
#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_attr_init(
  pthread_attr_t *attr
);
@end example

@subheading STATUS CODES:

@table @b
@item EINVAL
The attribute pointer argument is invalid.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

The @code{pthread_attr_init} routine initializes the thread attributes
object specified by @code{attr} with the default value for all of the
individual attributes.

@subheading NOTES:

The settings in the default attributes are implementation defined. For
RTEMS, the default attributes are as follows:

@itemize @bullet

@item stackadr
is not set to indicate that RTEMS is to allocate the stack memory.

@item stacksize
is set to @code{PTHREAD_MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE}.

@item contentionscope
is set to @code{PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS}.

@item inheritsched
is set to @code{PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED} to indicate that the created
thread inherits its scheduling attributes from its parent.

@item detachstate
is set to @code{PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE}.

The system lacked the necessary resources to create another thread, or the
self imposed limit on the total number of threads in a process
PTHREAD_THREAD_MAX would be exceeded.

@item EINVAL
Invalid argument passed.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

The @code{pthread_create} routine is used to create a new thread with
the attributes specified by @code{attr}. If the @code{attr} argument
is @code{NULL}, then the default attribute set will be used. Modification
of the contents of @code{attr} after this thread is created does not
have an impact on this thread.

The thread begins execution at the address specified by @code{start_routine}
with @code{arg} as its only argument. If @code{start_routine} returns,
then it is functionally equivalent to the thread executing the
@code{pthread_exit} service.

Upon successful completion, the ID of the created thread is returned in the
@code{thread} argument.

@subheading NOTES:

There is no concept of a single main thread in RTEMS as there is in
a tradition UNIX system. POSIX requires that the implicit return of
the main thread results in the same effects as if there were a call
to @code{exit}. This does not occur in RTEMS.

The signal mask of the newly created thread is inherited from its
creator and the set of pending signals for this thread is empty.

@subsection pthread_exit - Terminate the Current Thread

@findex pthread_exit
@cindex  terminate the current thread

@subheading CALLING SEQUENCE:

@example
#include <pthread.h>

void pthread_exit(
  void *status
);
@end example

@subheading STATUS CODES:
@table @b
@item NONE

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

The @code{pthread_exit} routine is used to terminate the calling thread.
The @code{status} is made available to any successful join with the
terminating thread.

When a thread returns from its start routine, it results in an
implicit call to the @code{pthread_exit} routine with the return
value of the function serving as the argument to @code{pthread_exit}.

@subheading NOTES:

Any cancellation cleanup handlers that hace been pushed and not yet popped
shall be popped in reverse of the order that they were pushed. After
all cancellation cleanup handlers have been executed, if the
thread has any thread-specific data, destructors for that data will
be invoked.

Thread termination does not release or free any application visible
resources including byt not limited to mutexes, file descriptors, allocated
memory, etc.. Similarly, exitting a thread does not result in any
process-oriented cleanup activity.

There is no concept of a single main thread in RTEMS as there is in
a tradition UNIX system. POSIX requires that the implicit return of
the main thread results in the same effects as if there were a call
to @code{exit}. This does not occur in RTEMS.

All access to any automatic variables allocated by the threads is lost
when the thread exits. Thus references (i.e. pointers) to local variables
of a thread should not be used in a global manner without care. As
a specific example, a pointer to a local variable should NOT be used
as the return value.

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

The @code{pthread_detach} routine is used to to indicate that storage
for @code{thread} can be reclaimed when the thread terminates without
another thread joinging with it.

@subheading NOTES:

If any threads have previously joined with the specified thread, then they
will remain joined with that thread. Any subsequent calls to
@code{pthread_join} on the specified thread will fail.

The @code{pthread_getattr_np} routine is used to obtain the

@subsection pthread_join - Wait for Thread Termination

@findex pthread_join
@cindex  wait for thread termination

@subheading CALLING SEQUENCE:

@example
#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_join(
  pthread_t    thread,
  void       **value_ptr
);
@end example

@subheading STATUS CODES:
@table @b
@item ESRCH
The thread specified is invalid.

@item EINVAL
The thread specified is not a joinable thread.

@item EDEADLK
A deadlock was detected or thread is the calling thread.

@end table

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

The @code{pthread_join} routine suspends execution of the calling thread
until @code{thread} terminates. If @code{thread} has already terminated,
then this routine returns immediately. The value returned by @code{thread}
(i.e. passed to @code{pthread_exit} is returned in @code{value_ptr}.

When this routine returns, then @code{thread} has been terminated.

@subheading NOTES:

The results of multiple simultaneous joins on the same thread is undefined.

If any threads have previously joined with the specified thread, then they
will remain joined with that thread. Any subsequent calls to
@code{pthread_join} on the specified thread will fail.

If value_ptr is NULL, then no value is returned.

The @code{pthread_equal} routine is used to compare two thread

   pthread_once_t   *once_control,
   void            (*init_routine)(void)
);
@end example

@subheading STATUS CODES:

NONE

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

The @code{pthread_once} routine is used to provide controlled initialization
of variables. The first call to @code{pthread_once} by any thread with the
same @code{once_control} will result in the @code{init_routine} being
invoked with no arguments. Subsequent calls to @code{pthread_once} with
the same @code{once_control} will have no effect.

The @code{init_routine} is guaranteed to have run to completion when
this routine returns to the caller.

@subheading NOTES:

The behavior of @code{pthread_once} is undefined if @code{once_control}
is automatic storage (i.e. on a task stack) or is not initialized using
@code{PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT}.

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

The @code{pthread_setschedparam} routine is used to set the
