@subsection help - Print command help

@pgindex help

@subheading SYNOPSYS:

@example
help misc
@end example

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

This command prints the command help. Help without arguments prints a
list of topics and help with a topic prints the help for that topic.

@subheading EXIT STATUS:

This command returns 0.

@subheading NOTES:

The help print will break the output up based on the environment
variable SHELL_LINES. If this environment variable is not set the
default is 16 lines. If set the number of lines is set to that the
value. If the shell lines is set 0 there will be no break.

@subheading EXAMPLES:

@subsection echo - produce message in a shell script

@pgindex echo

@subheading SYNOPSYS:

@example
echo [-n | -e] args ...
@end example

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

echo prints its arguments on the standard output, separated by spaces.
Unless the @b{-n} option is present, a newline is output following the
arguments.  The @b{-e} option causes echo to treat the escape sequences
specially, as described in the following paragraph.  The @b{-e} option is the
default, and is provided solely for compatibility with other systems.
Only one of the options @b{-n} and @b{-e} may be given.

If any of the following sequences of characters is encountered during
output, the sequence is not output.  Instead, the specified action is
performed:

@table @b
@item \b
A backspace character is output.

@item \c
Subsequent output is suppressed.  This is normally used at the
end of the last argument to suppress the trailing newline that
echo would otherwise output.

@item \f
Output a form feed.

@item \n
Output a newline character.

@item \r
Output a carriage return.

@item \t
Output a (horizontal) tab character.

@item \v
Output a vertical tab.

@item \0digits
Output the character whose value is given by zero to three digits.
If there are zero digits, a nul character is output.

@item \\
Output a backslash.

@end table

@subheading EXIT STATUS:

This command returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error is encountered.

@subheading NOTES:

The octal character escape mechanism (\0digits) differs from the C lan-
guage mechanism.

There is no way to force @code{echo} to treat its arguments literally, rather
than interpreting them as options and escape sequences.


@subheading EXAMPLES:

The following is an example of how to use @code{echo}:

@example
SHLL [/] $ echo a b c
a b c
SHLL [/] $ echo

@end example

@subheading CONFIGURATION:

@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_ECHO
@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_ECHO

This command is included in the default shell command set.
When building a custom command set, define
@code{CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_ECHO} to have this
command included.

This command can be excluded from the shell command set by
defining @code{CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_ECHO} when all
shell commands have been configured.

@subheading PROGRAMMING INFORMATION:

@findex rtems_shell_rtems_main_echo

The @code{echo} is implemented by a C language function
which has the following prototype:

@example
int rtems_shell_rtems_main_echo(
  int    argc,
  char **argv
);
@end example

The configuration structure for the @code{echo} has the
following prototype:

@example
extern rtems_shell_cmd_t rtems_shell_ECHO_Command;
@end example

@subheading ORIGIN:

The implementation and portions of the documentation for this
command are from NetBSD 4.0.

@subsection sleep - delay for a specified amount of time

@pgindex sleep

@subheading SYNOPSYS:

@example
sleep seconds
sleep seconds nanoseconds
@end example

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

This command causes the task executing the shell to block
for the specified number of @code{seconds} and @code{nanoseconds}.

@subheading EXIT STATUS:

This command returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error is encountered.

@subheading NOTES:

This command is implemented using the @code{nanosleep()} method.

The command line interface is similar to the @code{sleep} command
found on POSIX systems but the addition of the @code{nanoseconds}
parameter allows fine grained delays in shell scripts without
adding another command such as @code{usleep}.

@subheading EXAMPLES:

The following is an example of how to use @code{sleep}:

@example
SHLL [/] $ sleep 10
SHLL [/] $ sleep 0 5000000
@end example

It is not clear from the above but there is a ten second
pause after executing the first command before the prompt
is printed.  The second command completes very quickly
from a human perspective and there is no noticeable
delay in the prompt being printed.
@subheading CONFIGURATION:

@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_SLEEP
@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_SLEEP

This command is included in the default shell command set.
When building a custom command set, define

(uid), group id (gid), effective user id (euid), and effective
group id (egid).

@subheading EXIT STATUS:

This command returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error is encountered.

@subheading NOTES:

Remember there is only one POSIX process in a single processor RTEMS
application. Each thread may have its own user identity and that
identity is used by the filesystem to enforce permissions.

@subheading EXAMPLES:

The first example of the @code{id} command is from a session logged
in as the normal user @code{rtems}:

@example
SHLL [/] # id
uid=1(rtems),gid=1(rtems),euid=1(rtems),egid=1(rtems)
@end example

The second example of the @code{id} command is from a session logged

The @code{time} is implemented by a C language function
which has the following prototype:

@example
int rtems_shell_rtems_main_time(
  int    argc,
  char **argv
);
@end example

The configuration structure for the @code{time} has the
following prototype:

@example
extern rtems_shell_cmd_t rtems_shell_TIME_Command;
@end example

@subsection logoff - logoff from the system

@pgindex logoff

@subheading SYNOPSYS:

@example
logoff
@end example

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

This command logs the user out of the shell.

@subheading EXIT STATUS:

This command does not return.

@subheading NOTES:

The system behavior when the shell is exited depends upon how the
shell was initiated.  The typical behavior is that a login prompt
will be displayed for the next login attempt or that the connection
will be dropped by the RTEMS system.

@subheading EXAMPLES:

The following is an example of how to use @code{logoff}:

@example
SHLL [/] $ logoff
logoff from the system...
@end example

@subheading CONFIGURATION:

@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_LOGOFF
@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_LOGOFF

This command is included in the default shell command set.
When building a custom command set, define
@code{CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_LOGOFF} to have this
command included.

This command can be excluded from the shell command set by
defining @code{CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_LOGOFF} when all
shell commands have been configured.

@subheading PROGRAMMING INFORMATION:

@findex rtems_shell_rtems_main_logoff

The @code{logoff} is implemented by a C language function
which has the following prototype:

@example
int rtems_shell_rtems_main_logoff(
  int    argc,
  char **argv
);
@end example

@subheading CONFIGURATION:

@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_RTC
@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_RTC

This command is included in the default shell command set.
When building a custom command set, define
@code{CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_RTC} to have this
command included.

This command can be excluded from the shell command set by
defining @code{CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_RTC} when all

@subsection exit - exit the shell

@pgindex exit

@subheading SYNOPSYS:

@example
exit
@end example

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

This command causes the shell interpreter to @code{exit}.

@subheading EXIT STATUS:

This command does not return.

@subheading NOTES:

In contrast to @ref{General Commands logoff - logoff from the system, logoff},
this command is built into the shell interpreter loop.

@subheading EXAMPLES:

The following is an example of how to use @code{exit}:

@example
SHLL [/] $ exit
Shell exiting
@end example

@subheading CONFIGURATION:

This command is always present and cannot be disabled.

@subheading PROGRAMMING INFORMATION:

The @code{exit} is implemented directly in the shell interpreter.
There is no C routine associated with it.
