subsection is dedicated to each of the commands and
describes the behavior and configuration of that
command as well as providing an example usage.

@subsection shutdown - Shutdown the system

@pgindex shutdown

@subheading SYNOPSYS:

@example
shutdown
@end example

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

This command is used to shutdown the RTEMS application.

@subheading EXIT STATUS:

This command does not return.

@subheading NOTES:


@subheading EXAMPLES:

The following is an example of how to use @code{shutdown}:

@example
SHLL [/] $ shutdown
System shutting down at user request
@end example

The user will not see another prompt and the system will 
shutdown.

@subheading CONFIGURATION:

@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_SHUTDOWN
@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_SHUTDOWN

This command is included in the default shell command set.  
When building a custom command set, define
@code{CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_SHUTDOWN} to have this
command included.

This command can be excluded from the shell command set by
defining @code{CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_SHUTDOWN} when all
shell commands have been configured.

@subheading PROGRAMMING INFORMATION:

The configuration structure for the @code{shutdown} has the
following prototype:

@example
extern rtems_shell_cmd_t rtems_shell_SHUTDOWN_Command;
@end example

@c
@c
@c
@page
@subsection cpuuse - print or reset per thread cpu usage

@pgindex cpuuse

@subheading SYNOPSYS:

@example
cpuuse [-r]
@end example

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

This command may be used to print a report on the per thread
cpu usage or to reset the per thread CPU usage statistics. When
invoked with the @code{-r} option, the CPU usage statistics
are reset.

@subheading EXIT STATUS:

This command returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error is encountered.

@subheading NOTES:

The granularity of the timing information reported is dependent
upon the BSP and the manner in which RTEMS was built.  In the
default RTEMS configuration, if the BSP supports nanosecond
granularity timestamps, then the information reported will be
highly accurate. Otherwise, the accuracy of the information
reported is limited by the clock tick quantum.

@subheading EXAMPLES:

The following is an example of how to use @code{cpuuse}:

@example
SHLL [/] $ cpuuse
CPU Usage by thread
   ID            NAME         SECONDS   PERCENT
0x09010001   IDLE            49.745393   98.953
0x0a010001   UI1              0.000000    0.000
0x0a010002   SHLL             0.525928    1.046
Time since last CPU Usage reset 50.271321 seconds
SHLL [/] $ cpuuse -r
Resetting CPU Usage information
SHLL [/] $ cpuuse
CPU Usage by thread
   ID            NAME         SECONDS   PERCENT
0x09010001   IDLE             0.000000    0.000
0x0a010001   UI1              0.000000    0.000
0x0a010002   SHLL             0.003092  100.000
Time since last CPU Usage reset 0.003092 seconds
@end example

In the above example, the system had set idle for nearly
a minute when the first report was generated.  The 
@code{cpuuse -r} and @code{cpuuse} commands were pasted
from another window so were executed with no gap between.
In the second report, only the @code{shell} thread has
run since the CPU Usage was reset.  It has consumed
approximately 3.092 milliseconds of CPU time processing
the two commands and generating the output.

@subheading CONFIGURATION:

@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_CPUUSE
@findex CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_CPUUSE

This command is included in the default shell command set.  
When building a custom command set, define
@code{CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_CPUUSE} to have this
command included.

This command can be excluded from the shell command set by
defining @code{CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_CPUUSE} when all
shell commands have been configured.

@subheading PROGRAMMING INFORMATION:

@findex rtems_shell_rtems_main_cpuuse

The @code{cpuuse} is implemented by a C language function
which has the following prototype:

@subsection stackuse - print per thread stack usage

@pgindex stackuse

@subheading SYNOPSYS:

@example
stackuse
@end example

@subheading DESCRIPTION:

This command prints a Stack Usage Report for all of the tasks
and threads in the system.  On systems which support it, the
usage of the interrupt stack is also included in the report.

@subheading EXIT STATUS:

This command always succeeds and returns 0.

@subheading NOTES:

The @code{CONFIGURE_STACK_CHECKER_ENABLED} @code{confdefs.h} constant
must be defined when the application is configured for this
command to have any information to report.
