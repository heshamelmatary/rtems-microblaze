@chapter PowerPC Specific Information

This chapter discusses the PowerPC architecture dependencies
in this port of RTEMS.  The PowerPC family has a wide variety
of implementations by a range of vendors.  Consequently,
there are many, many CPU models within it.

It is highly recommended that the PowerPC RTEMS
application developer obtain and become familiar with the
documentation for the processor being used as well as the
specification for the revision of the PowerPC architecture which
corresponds to that processor.

@section CPU Model Dependent Features

This section presents the set of features which vary
across PowerPC implementations and are of importance to RTEMS.
The set of CPU model feature macros are defined in the file
@code{cpukit/score/cpu/powerpc/powerpc.h} based upon the particular CPU
model specified on the compilation command line.

@subsection Alignment

The macro PPC_ALIGNMENT is set to the PowerPC model's worst case alignment
requirement for data types on a byte boundary.  This value is used
to derive the alignment restrictions for memory allocated from 
regions and partitions.

@subsection Cache Alignment

The macro PPC_CACHE_ALIGNMENT is set to the line size of the cache.  It is
used to align the entry point of critical routines so that as much code
as possible can be retrieved with the initial read into cache.  This
is done for the interrupt handler as well as the context switch routines.

In addition, the "shortcut" data structure used by the PowerPC implementation
to ease access to data elements frequently accessed by RTEMS routines
implemented in assembly language is aligned using this value.

@subsection Maximum Interrupts

The macro PPC_INTERRUPT_MAX is set to the number of exception sources
supported by this PowerPC model.

@subsection Has Double Precision Floating Point

The macro PPC_HAS_DOUBLE is set to 1 to indicate that the PowerPC model
has support for double precision floating point numbers.  This is
important because the floating point registers need only be four bytes
wide (not eight) if double precision is not supported.

@subsection Critical Interrupts

The macro PPC_HAS_RFCI is set to 1 to indicate that the PowerPC model
has the Critical Interrupt capability as defined by the IBM 403 models.

@subsection Use Multiword Load/Store Instructions

The macro PPC_USE_MULTIPLE is set to 1 to indicate that multiword load and
store instructions should be used to perform context switch operations.
The relative efficiency of multiword load and store instructions versus
an equivalent set of single word load and store instructions varies based
upon the PowerPC model.

@subsection Instruction Cache Size

The macro PPC_I_CACHE is set to the size in bytes of the instruction cache.

@subsection Data Cache Size

The macro PPC_D_CACHE is set to the size in bytes of the data cache.

@subsection Debug Model

The macro PPC_DEBUG_MODEL is set to indicate the debug support features 
present in this CPU model.  The following debug support feature sets
are currently supported:

@table @b

@item @code{PPC_DEBUG_MODEL_STANDARD}
indicates that the single-step trace enable (SE) and branch trace
enable (BE) bits in the MSR are supported by this CPU model.

@item @code{PPC_DEBUG_MODEL_SINGLE_STEP_ONLY}
indicates that only the single-step trace enable (SE) bit in the MSR
is supported by this CPU model. 

@item @code{PPC_DEBUG_MODEL_IBM4xx}
indicates that the debug exception enable (DE) bit in the MSR is supported
by this CPU model.  At this time, this particular debug feature set 
has only been seen in the IBM 4xx series.

@end table

@subsubsection Low Power Model

The macro PPC_LOW_POWER_MODE is set to indicate the low power model
supported by this CPU model.  The following low power modes are currently
supported.

@table @b

@item @code{PPC_LOW_POWER_MODE_NONE}
indicates that this CPU model has no low power mode support.

@item @code{PPC_LOW_POWER_MODE_STANDARD}
indicates that this CPU model follows the low power model defined for
the PPC603e.

@section Calling Conventions

RTEMS supports the Embedded Application Binary Interface (EABI)
calling convention.  Documentation for EABI is available by sending
a message with a subject line of "EABI" to eabi@@goth.sis.mot.com.

@subsection Programming Model

This section discusses the programming model for the
PowerPC architecture.

@subsubsection Non-Floating Point Registers

The PowerPC architecture defines thirty-two non-floating point registers
directly visible to the programmer.  In thirty-two bit implementations, each
register is thirty-two bits wide.  In sixty-four bit implementations, each
register is sixty-four bits wide.

These registers are referred to as @code{gpr0} to @code{gpr31}.

Some of the registers serve defined roles in the EABI programming model.  
The following table describes the role of each of these registers:

@subsubsection Floating Point Registers

The PowerPC architecture includes thirty-two, sixty-four bit
floating point registers.  All PowerPC floating point instructions 
interpret these registers as 32 double precision floating point registers,
regardless of whether the processor has 64-bit or 32-bit implementation.

The floating point status and control register (fpscr) records exceptions
and the type of result generated by floating-point operations.
Additionally, it controls the rounding mode of operations and allows the
reporting of floating exceptions to be enabled or disabled.

@subsubsection Special Registers

The PowerPC architecture includes a number of special registers
which are critical to the programming model:

@table @b

@item Machine State Register

The MSR contains the processor mode, power management mode, endian mode,
exception information, privilege level, floating point available and
floating point excepiton mode, address translation information and
the exception prefix.

@item Link Register

The LR contains the return address after a function call.  This register
must be saved before a subsequent subroutine call can be made.  The
use of this register is discussed further in the @b{Call and Return
Mechanism} section below.

@item Count Register

The CTR contains the iteration variable for some loops.  It may also be used
for indirect function calls and jumps.

@end table

@subsection Call and Return Mechanism

The PowerPC architecture supports a simple yet effective call
and return mechanism.  A subroutine is invoked
via the "branch and link" (@code{bl}) and
"brank and link absolute" (@code{bla})
instructions.  This instructions place the return address
in the Link Register (LR).  The callee returns to the caller by 
executing a "branch unconditional to the link register" (@code{blr})
instruction.  Thus the callee returns to the caller via a jump
to the return address which is stored in the LR.

The previous contents of the LR are not automatically saved 
by either the @code{bl} or @code{bla}.  It is the responsibility
of the callee to save the contents of the LR before invoking
another subroutine.  If the callee invokes another subroutine,
it must restore the LR before executing the @code{blr} instruction
to return to the caller.

It is important to note that the PowerPC subroutine
call and return mechanism does not automatically save and
restore any registers.

The LR may be accessed as special purpose register 8 (@code{SPR8}) using the
"move from special register" (@code{mfspr}) and
"move to special register" (@code{mtspr}) instructions.

@subsection Calling Mechanism

All RTEMS directives are invoked using the regular
PowerPC EABI calling convention via the @code{bl} or
@code{bla} instructions.

@subsection Register Usage

As discussed above, the call instruction does not
automatically save any registers.  It is the responsibility
of the callee to save and restore any registers which must be preserved
across subroutine calls.  The callee is responsible for saving 
callee-preserved registers to the program stack and restoring them
before returning to the caller.

@subsection Parameter Passing

RTEMS assumes that arguments are placed in the
general purpose registers with the first argument in 
register 3 (@code{r3}), the second argument in general purpose
register 4 (@code{r4}), and so forth until the seventh
argument is in general purpose register 10 (@code{r10}).  
If there are more than seven arguments, then subsequent arguments
are placed on the program stack.  The following pseudo-code
illustrates the typical sequence used to call a RTEMS directive
with three (3) arguments:

@example
load third argument into r5
load second argument into r4
load first argument into r3
invoke directive
@end example

@c
@c
@c

@section Memory Model

@subsection Flat Memory Model

The PowerPC architecture supports a variety of memory models.
RTEMS supports the PowerPC using a flat memory model with 
paging disabled.  In this mode, the PowerPC automatically
converts every address from a logical to a physical address
each time it is used.  The PowerPC uses information provided
in the Block Address Translation (BAT) to convert these addresses.

Implementations of the PowerPC architecture may be thirty-two or sixty-four bit.
The PowerPC architecture supports a flat thirty-two or sixty-four bit address
space with addresses ranging from 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF (4
gigabytes) in thirty-two bit implementations or to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 
in sixty-four bit implementations.  Each address is represented
by either a thirty-two bit or sixty-four bit value and is byte addressable.  
The address may be used to reference a single byte, half-word
(2-bytes), word (4 bytes), or in sixty-four bit implementations a
doubleword (8 bytes).  Memory accesses within the address space are
performed in big or little endian fashion by the PowerPC based
upon the current setting of the Little-endian mode enable bit (LE)
in the Machine State Register (MSR).  While the processor is in
big endian mode, memory accesses which are not properly aligned
generate an "alignment exception" (vector offset 0x00600).  In
little endian mode, the PowerPC architecture does not require
the processor to generate alignment exceptions.

The following table lists the alignment requirements for a variety
of data accesses:

@ifset use-ascii
@example
@group
          +--------------+-----------------------+
          |   Data Type  | Alignment Requirement |
          +--------------+-----------------------+
          |     byte     |          1            |
          |   half-word  |          2            |
          |     word     |          4            |
          |  doubleword  |          8            |

Doubleword load and store operations are only available in 
PowerPC CPU models which are sixty-four bit implementations.

RTEMS does not directly support any PowerPC Memory Management
Units, therefore, virtual memory or segmentation systems
involving the PowerPC  are not supported.

@section Interrupt Processing

Although RTEMS hides many of the processor dependent
details of interrupt processing, it is important to understand
how the RTEMS interrupt manager is mapped onto the processor's
unique architecture. Discussed in this chapter are the PowerPC's
interrupt response and control mechanisms as they pertain to
RTEMS.

RTEMS and associated documentation uses the terms interrupt and vector.
In the PowerPC architecture, these terms correspond to exception and
exception handler, respectively.  The terms will be used interchangeably
in this manual.

@subsection Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Exceptions

In the PowerPC architecture exceptions can be either precise or 
imprecise and either synchronous or asynchronous.  Asynchronous 
exceptions occur when an external event interrupts the processor.
Synchronous exceptions are caused by the actions of an 
instruction. During an exception SRR0 is used to calculate where 
instruction processing should resume.  All instructions prior to
the resume instruction will have completed execution.  SRR1 is used to 
store the machine status.

There are two asynchronous nonmaskable, highest-priority exceptions
system reset and machine check.  There are two asynchrononous maskable
low-priority exceptions external interrupt and decrementer.  Nonmaskable
execptions are never delayed, therefore if two nonmaskable, asynchronous 
exceptions occur in immediate succession, the state information saved by
the first exception may be overwritten when the subsequent exception occurs. 

The PowerPC arcitecure defines one imprecise exception, the imprecise 
floating point enabled exception.  All other synchronous exceptions are
precise.  The synchronization occuring during asynchronous precise 
exceptions conforms to the requirements for context synchronization.

@subsection Vectoring of Interrupt Handler

Upon determining that an exception can be taken the PowerPC automatically
performs the following actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item an instruction address is loaded into SRR0

@item bits 33-36 and 42-47 of SRR1 are loaded with information 
specific to the exception.

@item bits 0-32, 37-41, and 48-63 of SRR1 are loaded with corresponding
bits from the MSR.

@item the MSR is set based upon the exception type.

@item instruction fetch and execution resumes, using the new MSR value, at a location specific to the execption type. 

@end itemize

If the interrupt handler was installed as an RTEMS
interrupt handler, then upon receipt of the interrupt, the
processor passes control to the RTEMS interrupt handler which
performs the following actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item saves the state of the interrupted task on it's stack,

@item saves all registers which are not normally preserved
by the calling sequence so the user's interrupt service
routine can be written in a high-level language.

@item if this is the outermost (i.e. non-nested) interrupt,
then the RTEMS interrupt handler switches from the current stack
to the interrupt stack,

@item enables exceptions,

@item invokes the vectors to a user interrupt service routine (ISR).
@end itemize

Asynchronous interrupts are ignored while exceptions are
disabled.  Synchronous interrupts which occur while are
disabled result in the CPU being forced into an error mode.

A nested interrupt is processed similarly with the
exception that the current stack need not be switched to the
interrupt stack.

@subsection Interrupt Levels

The PowerPC architecture supports only a single external
asynchronous interrupt source.  This interrupt source
may be enabled and disabled via the External Interrupt Enable (EE)
bit in the Machine State Register (MSR).  Thus only two level (enabled
and disabled) of external device interrupt priorities are 
directly supported by the PowerPC architecture.  

Some PowerPC implementations include a Critical Interrupt capability
which is often used to receive interrupts from high priority external
devices.

The RTEMS interrupt level mapping scheme for the PowerPC is not 
a numeric level as on most RTEMS ports.  It is a bit mapping in
which the least three significiant bits of the interrupt level
are mapped directly to the enabling of specific interrupt 
sources as follows:

@table @b

@item Critical Interrupt
Setting bit 0 (the least significant bit) of the interrupt level
enables the Critical Interrupt source, if it is available on this
CPU model.

@item Machine Check
Setting bit 1 of the interrupt level enables Machine Check execptions.

@item External Interrupt
Setting bit 2 of the interrupt level enables External Interrupt execptions.

@end table

All other bits in the RTEMS task interrupt level are ignored.

@c
@c
@c

@section Default Fatal Error Processing

The default fatal error handler for this architecture performs the
following actions:

@itemize @bullet

@item places the error code in r3, and

@item executes a trap instruction which results in a Program Exception.

@end itemize

If the Program Exception returns, then the following actions are performed:

@itemize @bullet

@item disables all processor exceptions by loading a 0 into the MSR, and

@item goes into an infinite loop to simulate a halt processor instruction.

@end itemize

@section Thread-Local Storage

Thread-local storage is supported.

@c
@c
@c

@section Board Support Packages

@subsection System Reset

An RTEMS based application is initiated or
re-initiated when the PowerPC processor is reset.  The PowerPC 
architecture defines a Reset Exception, but leaves the
details of the CPU state as implementation specific.  Please
refer to the User's Manual for the CPU model in question.

In general, at power-up the PowerPC begin execution at address
0xFFF00100 in supervisor mode with all exceptions disabled.  For
soft resets, the CPU will vector to either 0xFFF00100 or 0x00000100
depending upon the setting of the Exception Prefix bit in the MSR.
If during a soft reset, a Machine Check Exception occurs, then the
CPU may execute a hard reset.

@subsection Processor Initialization

If this PowerPC implementation supports on-chip caching
and this is to be utilized, then it should be enabled during the
reset application initialization code.  On-chip caching has been
observed to prevent some emulators from working properly, so it
may be necessary to run with caching disabled to use these emulators.

In addition to the requirements described in the
@b{Board Support Packages} chapter of the RTEMS C
Applications User's Manual for the reset code
which is executed before the call to @code{rtems_initialize_executive},
the PowrePC version has the following specific requirements:

@itemize @bullet
@item Must leave the PR bit of the Machine State Register (MSR) set 
to 0 so the PowerPC remains in the supervisor state.

@item Must set stack pointer (sp or r1) such that a minimum stack
size of MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE bytes is provided for the RTEMS initialization
sequence.

@item Must disable all external interrupts (i.e. clear the EI (EE)
bit of the machine state register).

@item Must enable traps so window overflow and underflow
conditions can be properly handled.

@item Must initialize the PowerPC's initial Exception Table with default
handlers.

@end itemize
