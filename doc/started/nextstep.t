@chapter Where To Go From Here

At this point, you should have successfully installed a GNU Cross
Compilation Tools for RTEMS on your host system as well as the RTEMS OS
for the target host.  You should have successfully linked the "hello
world" program. You may even have downloaded the executable to that
target and run it.  What do you do next?

The answer is that it depends.  You may be interested in writing an
application that uses one of the multiple APIs supported by RTEMS.
You may need to investigate the network or filesystem support in RTEMS.
The common thread is that you are largely finished with this manual and
ready to move on to others.

Whether or not you decide to dive in now and write application code or
read some documentation first, this chapter is for you.  The first section
provides a quick roadmap of some of the RTEMS documentation.  The next
section provides a brief overview of the RTEMS application structure.

@section Documentation Overview

When writing RTEMS applications, you should find the following manuals
useful because they define the calling interface to many of the services
provided by RTEMS:

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{RTEMS Applications C User's Guide} describes the
Classic RTEMS API based on the RTEID specification.

@item @b{RTEMS POSIX API User's Guide} describes the RTEMS POSIX API
that is based on the POSIX 1003.1b API. If there is any place where
this manual is thin or unclear, please refer to the OpenGroup Single
UNIX Specification.  RETEMS tracks that specification for future POSIX
revisions.

@item @b{RTEMS Network Supplement} provides information on the network
services provided by RTEMS.  RTEMS provides a BSD sockets programming
interface so any network programming book should be helpful.

@end itemize

In addition, the following manuals from the GNU Cross Compilation Toolset
include information on run-time services available.

@itemize @bullet
@item @b{C Support Library} describes the Standard C Library
functionality provided by Newlib's libc.

@item @b{C Math Library} describes the Standard C Math Library
functionality provided by Newlib's libm.

@end itemize

Finally, the RTEMS FAQ, Wiki, and mailing list archives are available 
at @uref{http://www.rtems.org, http://www.rtems.org}.

There is a wealth of documentation available for RTEMS and the GNU tools
supporting it.  If you run into something that is not clear or missing,
bring it to our attention.

Also, some of the RTEMS documentation is still under construction.
If you would like to contribute to this effort, please contact the
RTEMS Team at @uref{mailto:@value{RTEMSUSERS}, @value{RTEMSUSERS}}.
If you are interested in sponsoring the development of a new feature,
BSP, device driver, port of an existing library, etc., please contact
@uref{mailto:sales@@oarcorp.com, sales@@oarcorp.com}.

@section Writing an Application

From an application author's perspective, the structure of
an RTEMS application is very familiar.  In POSIX language,
RTEMS provides a single process, multi-threaded run-time
environment.  However there are two important things that are
different from a standard UNIX hosted program.

First, the application developer must provide configuration information
for RTEMS.  This configuration information includes limits on the maximum
number of various OS resources available and networking configuration
among other things.  See the @b{Configuring a System} in the @b{RTEMS
Applications C User's Guide} for more details.

Second, RTEMS applications may or may not start at @code{main()}.
Applications begin execution at one or more user configurable application
initialization tasks or threads.  It is possible to configure an
application to start with a single thread that whose entry point is
@code{main()}.

Each API supported by RTEMS (Internal, Classic, and POSIX) allows
the user to configure a set of one or more tasks that are created and
started automatically during RTEMS initialization.  The RTEMS Automatic
Configuration Generation (@code{confdefs.h}) scheme can be used to easily
generate the configuration information for an application that starts
with a single initialization task.  By convention, unless overridden,
the default name of the initialization task varies based up API.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{Init} - single Classic API Initialization Task

@item @code{POSIX_Init} - single POSIX API Initialization Thread
@end itemize

Regardless of the API used, when the initialization task executes,
all non-networking device drivers are normally initialized,
processor interrupts are enabled, and any C++ global constructors
have been run.  The initialization task then goes about its
business of performing application specific initialization which
will include initializing the networking subsystem if it is to be
used.  The application initialization may also involve creating
tasks and other system resources such as semaphores or message queues
and allocating memory.  In the RTEMS examples and tests, the
file @code{init.c} usually contains the initialization task.  Although
not required, in most of the examples, the initialization task
completes by deleting itself.

As you begin to write RTEMS application code, you may be confused by the
range of alternatives.  Supporting multiple tasking APIs can make the
choices confusing.  Many application groups writing new code choose one
of the APIs as their primary API and only use services from the others if
nothing comparable is in their preferred one.  However, the support for
multiple APIs is a powerful feature when integrating code from multiple
sources.  You can write new code using POSIX services and still use
services written in terms of the other APIs.  Moreover, by adding support
for yet another API, one could provide the infrastructure required to
migrate from a legacy RTOS with a non-standard API to an API like POSIX.
