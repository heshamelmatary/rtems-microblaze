This directory contains a telnetd server
primary features:

   + create a user shell pseudo-terminal task.

This code has not been extensively tested.  It is provided as a tool
for RTEMS users to open more shell tcp/ip pseudo-terminal.
Suggestions and comments are appreciated.

Read libmisc/shell for more information.

NOTES:

1.  OOB not yet implemented. Only a reduced negotiation is implemented.
    
2.  If you have tcp/ip initialied you can start telnetd daemon.
    You need register pseudo-terminals driver into device drivers table.

Enjoy it.

FUTURE:
