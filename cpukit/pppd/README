History

The original port was of 2.3.5 by Tomasz Domin <dot@comarch.pl> of
ComArch SA and was initially only tested on the mpc823.  He 
provided the modem driver as well.

The port was updated to 2.3.11 by Mike Siers <mikes@poliac.com>
who added an example test.

Updated the chat program to return the correct errors and support
the ABORT commands.  Removed some dead code and did a lot of
testing on a new Coldfire BSP.  Version seems to be very stable.

Update code to use RTEMS pppd network drivers.  Now the pppd
software is not dependent on using task driven mode.  This
change improved stablity and performance.  This was updated
by Mike Siers <mikes@poliac.com>.
