 * @brief Address the Problems Caused by Incompatible Flavor of 
 * Assemblers and Toolsets
 * 
 * This include file attempts to address the problems
 * caused by incompatible flavors of assemblers and
 * toolsets.  It primarily addresses variations in the
 * use of leading underscores on symbols and the requirement
 * that register names be preceded by a %.
 * 
 * NOTE: The spacing in the use of these macros
 *       is critical to them working as advertised.
