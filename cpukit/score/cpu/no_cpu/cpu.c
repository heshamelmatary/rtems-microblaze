 *  2. If you implement this using a "halt", "idle", or "shutdown"
 *     instruction, then don't forget to put it in an infinite loop.

 *  3. Be warned. Some processors with onboard DMA have been known
 *     to stop the DMA if the CPU were put in IDLE mode.  This might
 *     also be a problem with other on-chip peripherals.  So use this
 *     hook with caution.
