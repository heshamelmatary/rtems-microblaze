 
This port was done by Philip Quaife <philip@qs.co.nz> of Q Solutions
using RTEMS 3.5.1 under DOS and Hiview.   Philip used an H8300H
to develop and test this port.

It was updated to 4.5 and merged into the main development trunk
by Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>.  As part of the merger, the
port was made to conditionally compile for the H8, H8300H, and H8300S
series.

The status of each CPU subfamily is as follows.

H8  - Although RTEMS compiles with for these CPUs, it does not 
      truly support them.  All code that will not work on these
      CPUs is conditionally disabled.  These CPUs have a 16-bit
      address space.  Thus although a port is technically
      feasible, some work will to be performed on RTEMS to 
      further minimize its footprint and address pointer 
      manipulation issues.

H8H - Port was developed on this class of H8 so there should be
      no problems.

H8S - Port should work on this class of H8 but it is untested.
