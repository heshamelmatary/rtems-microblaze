# This board support package works with MCF5206eLITE evaluation board with
# Motorola Coldfire MCF5206e CPU.
#
# Many thanks to Balanced Audio Technology (http://www.balanced.com),
# company which donates MCF5206eLITE evaluation board, P&E Coldfire BDM 
# interface and provides support for development of this BSP and generic
# MCF5206 CPU code.
#
# Decisions made at compile time include:
#
# Decisions to be made a link-edit time are:
#     - The size of memory allocator heap. By default, all available
#       memory allocated for the heap. To specify amount of memory
#       available for heap:
#       LDFLAGS += -Wl,--defsym -Wl,HeapSize=xxx
#
#     - The frequency of system clock oscillator. By default, this frequency
#       is 54MHz. To select other clock frequency for your application, put
#       line like this in application Makefile: 
#       LDFLAGS += -qclock=40000000
#
#     - Select between RAM or ROM images. By default, RAM image generated
#       which may be loaded starting from address 0x30000000 to the RAM.
#       To prepare image intended to be stored in ROM, put the following
#       line to the application Makefile:
#       LDFLAGS += -qflash
#
#       You may select other memory configuration providing your own
#       linker script.
