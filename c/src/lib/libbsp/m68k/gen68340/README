#
# This board support package works both MC68340 and MC68349 systems.
#
# Special console features:
# - support of polled and interrupts mode (both MC68340 and MC68349)
# - support of FIFO FULL mode (only for MC68340, the MC68349 doesn't have any timer, so
#   you may write your own timer driver if you have an external one)
# 
# The type of the board is automatically recognised in the initialization sequence.
#
# WARNING: there's still no network driver!
#   I hope it will come in the next RTEMS version!
