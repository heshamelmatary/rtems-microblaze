/*
 *  This code was copied from other MC680x0 MVME BSPs.
 *  Our guess is that someone was concerned about the CPU no longer being in
 *  supervisor mode when they got here. This function forces the CPU back to
 *  supervisor mode so the VBR may be changed. It places the address of the
 *  function that makes a 167Bug .RETURN syscall in the trap 13 entry in the
 *  exception vector, and then issues a trap 13 call. It is also possible that
 *  the code was copied from some other OS that does run tasks in user mode.
 *  In any case, it appears to be a bit of paranoia, and could lead to
 *  problems if 167Bug is invoked before we get to switch the VBR back to
 *  167Bug because trap 13 is documented as being reserved for the internal
 *  use of the debugger.
