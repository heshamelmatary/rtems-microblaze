/*  page_table.c
 *
 *  The code submitted by Eric Vaitl <vaitl@viasat.com> for the MVME162 appears
 *  to be for a uniprocessor implementation. The function that sets up the
 *  page tables, page_table_init(), is not data driven. For all processors, it
 *  sets up page tables to map virtual addresses from 0x20000 to 0x3FFFFF to
 *  physical addresses 0x20000 to 0x3FFFFF. This presumably maps a subset of
 *  a local 4 MB space, which is probably the amount of RAM on Eric Vailt's
 *  MVME162.
 *
 *  It is possible to set up the various bus bridges in the MVME167s to create
 *  a flat physical address space across multiple boards, i.e., it is possible
 *  for each MVME167 in a multiprocessor system to access a given memory
 *  location using the same physical address, whether that location is in local
 *  or VME space. Addres translation can be set up so that each virtual address
 *  maps to its corresponding physical address, e.g. virtual address 0x12345678
 *  is mapped to physical address 0x12345678. With this mapping, the MMU is
 *  only used to control the caching modes for the various regions of memory.
 *  Mapping the virtual addresses to their corresponding physical address makes
 *  it unnecessary to map addresses under software control during the
 *  initialization of RTEMS, before address translation is turned on.
 *
 *  With the above approach, address translation may be set up either with the
 *  transparent address translation registers, or with page tables. If page
 *  tables are used, a more efficient use of page table space can be achieved
 *  by sharing the page tables between processors. The entire page table tree
 *  can be shared, or each processor can hold a private copy of the top nodes
 *  which point to leaf nodes stored on individual processors.
 *
 *  In this port, only the transparent address translation registers are used.
 *  We map the entire virtual range from 0x0 to 0x7FFFFFFF to the identical
 *  physical range 0x0 to 0x7FFFFFFF. We rely on the hardware to signal bus
 *  errors if we address non-existent memory within this range. Our two
 *  MVME167s are configured to exist at physical addresses 0x00800000 to
 *  0x00BFFFFF and 0x00C00000 to 0x00FFFFFF respectively. If jumper J1-4 is
 *  installed, memory and cache control can be done by providing parameters
 *  in NVRAM and jumpers J1-[5-7] are ignored. See the README for details.
 *  If J1-4 is removed, behaviour defaults to the following. We map the space
 *  from 0x0 to 0x7FFFFFFF as copyback, unless jumper J1-5 is removed, in which
 *  case we map as writethrough. If jumper J1-7 is removed, the data cache is
 *  NOT enabled. If jumper J1-6 is removed, the instruction cache is not enabled.
