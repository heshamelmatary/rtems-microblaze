/*
 *  Implementation of the Clock_initialize() functions
 *  prototyped in rtems/c/src/lib/include/clockdrv.h.
 *
 *  This port does not allow the application to select which timer on the
 *  MVME167 to use for the clock, nor does it allow the application to
 *  configure the clock. The clock uses the VMEchip2 Tick Timer #2. This
 *  timer is set up to raise a MC680x0 level-6 interrupt every 1 ms. The
 *  interrupt vector is 0x69.
 *
 *  All page references are to the MVME166/MVME167/MVME187 Single Board
 *  Computer Programmer's Reference Guide (MVME187PG/D2) with the April
 *  1993 supplements/addenda (MVME187PG/D2A1).
