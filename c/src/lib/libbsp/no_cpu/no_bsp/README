#  This is a sample hardware description file for a BSP.  This comment
#  block does not have to appear in a real one.  The intention of this
#  file is to provide a central place to look when searching for
#  information about a board when starting a new BSP.  For example,
#  you may want to find an existing timer driver for the chip you are
#  using on your board.  It is easier to grep for the chip name in
#  all of the HARDWARE files than to peruse the source tree.  Hopefully,
#  making the HARDDWARE files accurate will also alleviate the common
#  problem of not knowing anything about a board based on its BSP
#  name.
#
#  NOTE:  If you have a class of peripheral chip on board which
#         is not in this list please add it to this file so
#         others will also use the same name.
#
#         Timer resolution is the way it is configured in this BSP.
#         On a counting timer, this is the length of time which
#         corresponds to 1 count.
