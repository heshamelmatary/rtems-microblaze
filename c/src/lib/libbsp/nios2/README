#  Goal is to have BSPs build almost completely automatically from a template
#  and information that comes from SOPC Builder as a .PTF file. Most of the
#  code will go to a shared/ BSP directory.
#
#  Ideally, updates to the PTF shouldn't cause any pain for the maintainer
#  of a specific BSP (possibly with enhancements not covered by the
#  automatic BSP creation).
#
#  Some first steps toward utilizing SOPC Builder PTF output can be found
#  in top level /tools/cpu/nios2. Also see the README there.
#
#   Implemented (in shared/ subdirectory)
#     Clock driver
#     Timer driver
#     Console via JTAG UART
#
#   Todo;
#     Support more peripherals. My priorities:
#       - (improve) Altera Avalon JTAG UART
#       - Altera Avalon UART
#       - OpenCores.org I2C Master
#       - Altera SPI Core / EPCS Configuration Device
#       - OpenCores.org 10/100 Ethernet MAC (use existing driver)
#       - (more) Altera Avalon Timer
#
#     Put all drivers aside in a shared/ subdirectory.
#     Update the "times" file for NIOS2 with and without icache.
#
#   Missing (although it looks like it's there)
#     Data cache handling (for now, don't use the "fast" NIOS2)
#     SHM support (just taken over the code from no_cpu/no_bsp)
