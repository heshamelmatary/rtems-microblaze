/* AMBAPP helper routine to find a device by index. The function is given to
 * ambapp_for_each, the argument may be NULL (find first device) or a pointer
 * to a index which is downcounted until 0 is reached. If the int-pointer
 * points to a value of:
 *   0  - first device is returned
 *   1  - second device is returned
 *   ...
 *
 * The matching device is returned, which will stop the ambapp_for_each search.
 * If zero is returned from ambapp_for_each no device matching the index was
 * found
