To build and run the tests for this BSP, use the RTEMS tester.
The necessary software can be built with the RTEMS source builder.

To build the BSP for testing:
	- set CONSOLE_POLLED=1 in the configure environment, some tests
	  assume console i/o is polled
	- add --enable-tests to the configure line

1. Qemu

Linaro Qemu can emulate the beagleboard xm and so run all regression
tests in software. Build the bbxm.bset from the RTEMS source builder and
you will get qemu linaro that can run them. There is a beagleboardxm_qemu
bsp in the RTEMS tester to invoke it with every test.

2. bbxm hardware

This requires JTAG, see README.JTAG. Use the beagleboardxm bsp in the
RTEMS tester. It starts gdb to connect to openocd to reset the target
and load the RTEMS executable for each test iteration.
