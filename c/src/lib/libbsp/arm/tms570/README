Development Board: TMS570LS31x Hercules Development Kit from TI

http://www.ti.com/tool/tmds570ls31hdk

Drivers:

	o Console
	o Clock
  o Ethernet - work in progress

BSP variants:
  tms570ls3137_hdk_intram - place code and data into internal SRAM
  tms570ls3137_hdk_sdram - place code into external SDRAM and data to SRAM
  tms570ls3137_hdk - variant prepared for stand-alone RTEMS application
                      stored and running directly from flash. Not working yet.

Tool-chain
  GCC 4.9.0 + Newlib 2.1.0 + Binutils 2.24 configuration:

  CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe" LDFLAGS=-s \
  ../../../src/gcc-4.9/configure --target=arm-rtems4.11 --prefix=/usr \
               --enable-languages=c,c++ \

               --enable-newlib-iconv \
               --disable-lto \

Patches required for Cortex-R and big-endian ARM support are already
accepted by the mainline.

Execution

Currently, a bootloader is not used. For test and debug purposes, TI's
HalCoGen generated application is used to set up the board and then
the RTEMS application image is loaded using OpenOCD to internal
EEC SRAM or external DRAM. The following features are
not implemented in the BSP:

 + Initial complex CPU and peripheral initialization
 + Cores Self-test

Setup application code is available there:
          https://github.com/hornmich/tms570ls3137-hdk-sdram

Howto setup TMDS570LS31HDK?

	o Unpack board.	
	o Verify that demo application runs.
  o Upload bootloader specified above
  o write BSP application either to sdram or intram and jump to RTEMS start code
