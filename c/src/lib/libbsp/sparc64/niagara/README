This BSP is designed to operate on the UltraSPARC T1 (Niagara) SPARC64 
and similar processors.

This BSP has been run on the Simics simulator with the niagara target, which 
simulates the OpenSPARC T1 Niagara implementation.

This BSP has been run on the M5 simulator with the SPARC_FS target, which
simulates the OpenSPARC T1 Niagara implementation.
