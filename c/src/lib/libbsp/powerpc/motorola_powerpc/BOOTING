This file documents the on board monitor (PPCBUG) configuration used
to be able to boot the archives located in powerpc-rtems/c/mcp750/bin.

NOTE (by Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>, 2003):
Apparently, PPCBug fails to shut down the network interface after
loading an image. This means that the ethernet chip is still able
to write into its descriptors and network buffer memory which
can result in the loaded system to be corrupted if that system
relocates itself!. The proper place to shut down the interface
would be PPCBug itself or a 'PPCBug startup script' - unfortunately,
PPCBug doesn't offer such a feature. Therefore, the bootloader
is by default compiled with the
#ifdef USE_PPCBUG
compile-time option ENABLED. It will then use a PPCBug system
call to shut down the ethernet chip during an early stage of
the boot process.
NOTE: THIS (i.e. the system call) WILL FAIL IF YOU USE SOFTWARE
OTHER THAN PPCBUG TO BOOT THE BSP. In such a case, you must
recompile with #undef USE_PPCBUG and make sure the ethernet
interface is quiet by other means.
