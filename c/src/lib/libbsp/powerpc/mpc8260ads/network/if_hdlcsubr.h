 * RTEMS/TCPIP driver for MPC8260 SCC HDLC networking

 *   On the ADS board the ethernet interface is connected to FCC2
 *   but in my application I want TCP over HDLC (see README)
 *   so will use SCC3 as the network interface. I have other plans
 *   for the FCCs so am unlikely to add true ethernet support to
 *   this BSP.  Contributions welcome!
