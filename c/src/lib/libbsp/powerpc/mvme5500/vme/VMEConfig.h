/* VMEConfig.h, S. Kate Feng modified it for MVME5500 3/04 
 * 
 * May 2011 : Use the VME shared IRQ handlers.
 *
 * It seems that the implementation of VMEUNIVERSE_IRQ_MGR_FLAG_PW_WORKAROUND
 * is not fully developed. The UNIV_REGOFF_VCSR_BS is defined for VME64
 * specification, which does not apply to a VME32 crate. In order to avoid
 * spurious VME interrupts, a better and more universal solution is
 * to flush the vmeUniverse FIFO by reading a register back within the
 * users' Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)  before returning.
 *
 * Some devices might require the ISR to issue an interrupt status READ
 * after its IRQ is cleared, but before its corresponding interrupt
 * is enabled again.
