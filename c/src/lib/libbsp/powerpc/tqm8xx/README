Board description
-----------------
Clock rate:     50MHz - 133MHz.
Bus width:      32 bit Flash, 32 bit DRAM
FLASH:	        2-8MB
RAM:            32-256MB SDRAM


Installation
------------

Port Description
Console driver
---------------

This BSP contains a console driver for polled and interrupt-driven
operation. It supports SCCs and SMCs.
During BSP configuration, various variables can be set to activate a
certain channels and to specify the console channel:

CONS_SMC1_MODE, CONS_SMC2_MODE, CONS_SCC[1-4]_MODE can be set to
CONS_MODE_UNUSED, CONS_MODE_POLLED or CONS_MODE_IRQ

The driver always uses termios. 

printk() and debug output
-----------------------
<tbd>

Floating-point
--------------

The MPC8xx do not have floating-point units. All code should
get compiled with the appropriate -mcpu flag. The nof variants of the gcc
runtime libraries should be used for linking.



Miscellaneous
-------------

All development was based on the mbx8xx and gen68360 port.
