/*
 * Glue interface -- to be used only internally by BSP
 * and chip drivers:
 * - BSP provides info about what chip drivers to use
 *   as well as 'wiring' info (how many devices are
 *   operated in parallel etc).
 * - Chip drivers provide low-level 'methods' / 'ops'
 *   for performing basic operations which are used
 *   by the code in 'flash.c'.
 */

/* To keep things simple, this API makes a few assumptions about the
 * hardware:
 *
 * - devices operate with 16-bit data width
 * - two devices are used in parallel (stride 4) to
 *   provide 32-bit data. I.e., the devices are
 *   organized like this:
 *   unsigned short flash[FLASH_SIZE][2];
 * - no endianness issues (i.e., flash endianness ==  CPU endianness)
 * - fixed block size
 * - fixed buffer size
 * - all devices in a bank are identical
 * - NOT THREAD SAFE; no locking scheme is implemented.
 * - cannot copy within same flash bank.
 * - write-timeout uses polling/busy-wait
 *
 * FIXME: code should be revised to remove assumptions on stride and 16-bit
 *        width to make it more generic.

 * Description of a flash bank. Multiple
 * devices that are used in parallel to
 * make up words of FLASH_STRIDE bytes
 * are a 'physical' bank.
 *
 * A bank can even be a 'logical' bank
 * if it includes chip-select logic, i.e.,
 * int can contain multiple adjacent
 * 'physical' banks
 *
 * The BSP must provide an array of 'bankdesc'
 * structs and it must initialize the fields
 *
 *   'start'
 *     size of bank; may be set to zero to instruct
 *     the driver to scan a bank of 'max_size' for
 *     devices (i.e., bank may not be fully populated)
 *   'max_size'
 *     size of fully populated bank (defines address range
 *     that is scanned for devices).
 *     If 'max_size' is negative then scanning starts from
 *     the top rather than from the bottom.
 *   'width'
 *     width of a single device (in bytes). E.g., if
 *     2 16-bit devices are used to form a (ATM fixed)
 *     stride of 4 then 'width = 2'. If four 8-bit
 *     devices are employed then 'width=1'.
 *   'knownVendors'
 *     array of vendors descriptions to use for scanning
 *     the bank.
