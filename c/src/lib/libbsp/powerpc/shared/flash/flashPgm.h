/* IMPORTANT NOTE
 *
 * The flash API is NOT THREAD SAFE. During the execution of any of the
 * BSP_flashXXX() routines, flash (residing in the same device)
 * MUST NOT be accessed by other threads in ANY way (NOT EVEN READ!).
 * Read operations may return internal device register contents
 * instead of memory array data when issued while a flash device
 * is erased, written or queried by the library.
 *
 * The routines are intended for occasional maintenance use only
 * (i.e., not for implementing a file system or similar).
 *
 * While polling for the completion of block erase operations the
 * CPU is yielded to other threads. Busy waiting (interrupts and
 * thread dispatching remain enabled) on write operations is employed.

/* Disengage flash write protection. Write protection is implemented
 * at the board or chipset level by disabling all write operations/bus cycles
 * to the flash device(s).
 * With write protection enabled, nothing but 'ordinary' (array) read operations
 * are possible.
 * Write protection must be disabled not only to erase and write contents
 * but also in order to read ID, size, status etc.
 * None of the operations (except for BSP_flashWriteEnable()) are possible
 * on a write-protected device.
 *
 *  'bank': flash bank # (usually 0)
 * RETURNS: 0 on success, nonzero on error (printing message to stderr).
 *
 *   NOTES: - some boards (MVME5500) don't support 'bank' granularity but
 *            enable/disable write protection for all devices at once.
 *          - a jumper-based protection mechanism might be in place
 *            in addition to the software-based one. Consult the user's
 *            manual of your board for more information.

 *    NOTES: - 'offset' and 'size' must be block-aligned. Common 16-bit devices

 *    NOTES: - Erase operations are only performed where necessary. I.e.,
 *           if one or both of the boundaries of the destination region is/are
 *           not block-aligned then adjacent data are preserved provided that

 *           is blank then '<neighbour>'-data is preserved. The end of the
 *           destination is treated the same way.)
 *
 *           - user confirmation is requested before changes are made
 *
 *           - 'src' must not point into the destination bank (no copy
