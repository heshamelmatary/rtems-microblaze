/* Simple memory probing routine
 *
 *  - call from MMU-disabled section to avoid having to
 *	  set up mappings.
 *    NOTE: this implies WIMG = 0011
 *  - call AFTER image is at its destination and PRIOR
 *    to setting up the heap or using any memory beyond
 *    __rtems_end, i.e., the probing algorithm may safely
 *    tamper with memory > __rtems_end.
 *  - MUST lock caches since we're gonna hit space with
 *    no memory attached.
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS:
 *		o image occupies addresses between 0..__rtems_end
 *		o memory size is a multiple of 1<<LD_MEM_PROBE_STEP
 *
 * CAVEATS:
 *      o all caches must be disabled or locked (some
 *        boards really don't like it if you try to
 *        cache physical addresses with nothing attached)
 *        and this is highly CPU dependent :-(...
 *
 *	- RETURNS size of memory detected in bytes or 0 on
 *    error.
