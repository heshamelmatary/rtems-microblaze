/* Default setup of the page tables. This is a weak
 * alias, so applications may easily override this
 * default setup.
 *
 * NOTE: while it is possible to change the individual
 *       mappings, the page table itself MUST be
 *       allocated at the top of the physical memory!
 *       bspstart.c RELIES on this.
 *       Also, the 'setup' routine must reduce
 *       *pmemsize by the size of the page table.
