Notes
=====

Based on papyrus bsp which only really supports
the PowerOpen ABI with an ELF assembler.

For the multiprocessing tests to run, you must have a modified version of
the PowerPC Simulator psim which supports an area of UNIX shared memory
and UNIX semaphore mapped into the PowerPC address space.
