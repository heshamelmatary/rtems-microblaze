/* If your BSP requires a non-standard way to configure

 * to a proper instruction sequence that installs the
 * universe interrupt manager. This requires knowledge
 * of the wiring between the universe and the PIC (main
 * interrupt controller), i.e., which IRQ 'pins' of the
 * universe are wired to which 'lines'/inputs at the PIC.
 * (consult vmeUniverse.h for more information).
 *
 * When installing the universe IRQ manager it is also
 * possible to specify whether it should try to share
 * PIC interrupts with other sources. This might not
 * be supported by all BSPs (but the unverse driver
 * recognizes that).
 *
 * If BSP_VME_INSTALL_IRQ_MGR is undefined then
 * the default algorithm is used (vme_universe.c):
 *
 * This default setup uses only a single wire. It reads
 * the PIC 'line' from PCI configuration space and assumes
 * this to be wired to the first (LIRQ0) IRQ input at the
 * universe. The default setup tries to use interrupt
 * sharing.
