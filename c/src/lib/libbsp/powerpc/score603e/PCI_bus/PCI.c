/*
 * Forced delay to get around timing problems with the UNIVERSE chip.  The
 * two nops are used so that the delay works for varying clock frequencies,
 * up to 66 Mhz, with margin.  Each nop averages about 1 1/2 clock ticks,
 * and since there are 2 nops, this routine takes about 3 clock ticks,
 * which on a worst case 66 Mhz board, is 45 nanosecond. This time period
 * is sufficient to guarantee a work-around to the UNIVERSE chip timing
 * problem.  The problem is that when there are two successive accesses to
 * an UNIVERSE register, without sufficient delay, the second access will
 * not work correctly.
