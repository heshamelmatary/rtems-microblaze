NOTES
=====

(1) The present 'hw_init.c' file provides 'early_hw_init'(void) which
    is normally called from 'start.S' to provide such minimal HW setup
    as is conveniently written in 'C' and can make use of global
    symbols for 7045F processor elements. It also provides
    'void bsp_hw_init (void)' normally called from 'bspstart.c', shortly
    before RTEMS itself is started.

    These are both minimal functions intended to support the RTEMS test
    suites.
