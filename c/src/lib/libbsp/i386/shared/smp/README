The following files were developed by  Erich Boleyn  <erich@uruk.org>.
The original files were copied from http://www.uruk.org/mps/ and committed
into cvs as is.  These files will be modified for RTEMS smp support,
but the original files are being commited in order to track any file
changes that occur.  We are attempting to keep these changes as minimal
and conainted as possible.
