#
# This board support package works with a target PC
#
# Decisions to be made a link-edit time are:
#     - The size of the memory allocator heap.  The default value is
#       64 kbytes.  If the network package is used the heap
#       should be at least 256 kbytes.  If your network is large, or
#       busy, the heap should be even larger.
#       To choose a heap size of 256 kbytes,
#       CFLAGS_LD += -Wl,--defsym -Wl,HeapSize=0x40000
