/*
 * The macros in this file are specific to a given implementation.
 * The general rules for their construction are as follows:
 *
 * 1.) is_readable(addr,length) should be true if and only if the
 *     region starting at the given virtual address can be read
 *     _without_ causing an exception or other fatal error.  Note
 *     that the stub will use the strictest alignment satisfied
 *     by _both_ addr and length (e.g., if both are divisible by
 *     8 then the region will be read in double-word chunks).
 *
 * 2.) is_writeable(addr,length) should be true if and only if the
 *     region starting at the given virtual address can be written
 *     _without_ causing an exception or other fatal error.  Note
 *     that the stub will use the strictest alignment satisfied
 *     by _both_ addr and length (e.g., if both are divisible by
 *     8 then the region will be written in double-word chunks).
 *
 * 3.) is-steppable(ptr) whould be true if and only if ptr is the
 *     address of a writeable region of memory which may contain
 *     an executable instruction.  At a minimum this requires that
 *     ptr be word-aligned (divisible by 4) and not point to EPROM
 *     or memory-mapped I/O.
 *
 * Note: in order to satisfy constraints related to cacheability
 * of certain memory subsystems it may be necessary for regions
 * of kseg0 and kseg1 which map to the same physical addresses
 * to have different readability and/or writeability attributes.
