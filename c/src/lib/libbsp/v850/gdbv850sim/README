This directory contains a family of BSPs for the v850 simulator
found in the GNU Debugger. A variant is provided for each CPU
model option flag found in the GCC SVN head as of 30 May 2012.

This simulator is an instruction simulator and does not include
devices for a clock tick or benchmark timer driver. Traps are used
to provide console I/O.
