/*  timer.c
 *
 *  This file manages the benchmark timer used by the RTEMS Timing
 *  Test Suite.  Each measured time period is demarcated by calls to
 *  benchmark_timer_initialize() and benchmark_timer_read().
 *  benchmark_timer_read() usually returns the number of microseconds
 *  since benchmark_timer_initialize() exitted.
 *
 *  NOTE: It is important that the timer start/stop overhead be
 *        determined when porting or modifying this code.
