/**
 * @file
 * @brief Handle MCF5272 TIMER2 interrupts.
 *
 * All code in this routine is pure overhead which can perturb the
 * accuracy of RTEMS' timing test suite.
 *
 * See also:	benchmark_timer_read()
 *
 * To reduce overhead this is best to be the "rawest" hardware interupt
 * handler you can write.  This should be the only interrupt which can
 * occur during the measured time period.
 *
 * An external counter, Timer_interrupts, is incremented.
