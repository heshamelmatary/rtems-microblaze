This hierarchy contains support routines for the Analog Devices
Blackfin family of processors.

It is assumed that bsp.h includes <libcpu/bfxxx.h>, where xxx is
the processor type.  This is how the libcpu modules determine which

serial/sport* is currently just a placeholders.  serial/twi* does not
contain enough code to do anything useful; it is however a start at an
I2C driver.
