/*  The information contained in the Node Status, Locked Queue, and

 *  NOTE: XXX
 *                PORTABILITY OF LOCKING INSTRUCTIONS
 *                ===================================
 *            The locking mechanism described below is not
 *            general enough.  Where the hardware supports
 *            it we should use "atomic swap" instructions
 *            so the values in the lock can be tailored to
 *            support a CPU with only weak atomic memory
 *            instructions.  There are combinations of
 *            CPUs with inflexible atomic memory instructions
 *            which appear to be incompatible.  For example,
 *            the SPARClite instruction uses a byte which is
 *            0xFF when locked.  The PA-RISC uses 1 to indicate
 *            locked and 0 when unlocked.  These CPUs appear to
 *            have incompatible lock instructions.  But
 *            they could be used in a heterogenous system
 *            with does not mix SPARCs and PA-RISCs.  For
 *            example, the i386 and SPARC or i386 and SPARC
 *            could work together.  The bottom line is that
 *            not every CPU will work together using this
 *            locking scheme.  There are supposed to be
 *            algorithms to do this without hardware assist
 *            and one of these should be incorporated into
 *            the shared memory driver.
 *
 *            The most flexible scheme using the instructions
 *            of the various CPUs for efficiency would be to use
 *            "atomic swaps" wherever possible.  Make the lock
 *            and unlock configurable much like BIG vs LITTLE
 *            endian use of shared memory is now.  The values
 *            of the lock could then reflect the "worst"
 *            CPU in a system.  This still results in mixes
 *            of CPUs which are incompatible.
 *
 *  The current locking mechanism is based upon the MC68020
 *  "tas" instruction which is atomic.  All ports to other CPUs
 *  comply with the restrictive placement of lock bit by this
 *  instruction.  The lock bit is the most significant bit in a
 *  big-endian uint32_t  .  On other processors, the lock is
 *  typically implemented via an atomic swap or atomic modify
 *  bits type instruction.

/*
 *  The following are the values used to fill in the lock field.  Some CPUs
 *  are able to write only a single value into field.  By making the
 *  lock and unlock values configurable, CPUs which support "atomic swap"
 *  instructions can generally be made to work in any heterogeneous
 *  configuration.  However, it is possible for two CPUs to be incompatible
 *  in regards to the lock field values.  This occurs when two CPUs
 *  which write only a single value to the field are used in a system
 *  but the two CPUs write different incompatible values.
 *
 *  NOTE:  The following is a first attempt at defining values which
 *         have a chance at working together.  The m68k should use
 *         chk2 instead of tas to be less restrictive.  Target endian
 *         problems (like the Force CPU386 which has (broken) big endian
 *         view of the VMEbus address space) are not addressed yet.
