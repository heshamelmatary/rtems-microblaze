This is the network interface controller portion of the libchip library.
This directory contains the source code for reusable TCP/IP network driver
support code.  Each driver has its own configuration table and its
chip specific attach routine must be called by a board specific
attach routine.  The board specific chip routine passes the chip
configuration and network configuration to the resuable device driver.

The reusable chip drivers do not directly access the controller.
They access the registers on the controller via a set of
functions which are provided by the BSP.  These functions set and get
general registers and data buffers.
