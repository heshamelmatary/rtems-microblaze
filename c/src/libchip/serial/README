This is the serial controller portion of the libchip library.  This 
directory contains the source code for reusable console driver
support code.  Each individual driver is configured using the
console_tbl data structure.  This structure is defined and explained
in the console.h file.

The reusable chip drivers do not directly access the serial controller.
They access the registers on the controller via a set of up to four 
functions which are provided by the BSP.  These functins set and get
general registers and data buffers.  Some chips can access the data
buffers as general registers and thus the driver may not require
those interface routines.
