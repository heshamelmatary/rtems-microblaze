General
=======

+ Hardware flow control is not currently supported.  Some of the chip
  drivers (in particular the z8530) have support for hardware flow control
  but this has not been tested in the libchip context.  There will need
  to be a way to totally disabled hardware flow control which is not
  currently in this.

+ "ulClockSpeed" configuration item field to become a pointer to a table
  of chip specific information.  For example, the z8530 should specify
  clock speed and clock divisor setting.

+ A termios structure should be included to specify  the initial settings.
  Right now all drivers default to 9600, 8N1.
 
+ Need to switch to passing pointers rather than a minor number to 
  functions which are strictly internal to each chip driver.  This
  should be a performance win.

+ Need a test which prompts you for termios settings and tests them.  Until
  this happens, testing for the variety of settings possible will be limited.
  This test should be able to test any serial port while prompts come to the
  console.

MC68681
=======

+ Works interrupt and polled.

+ Hardware flow control not included.

NS16650
=======

+ ns16550_set-attributes function is untested.

+ Hardware flow control included but is currently disabled in ISR.

Z85C30
======

+ Works polled and interrupt.

+ Hardware flow control included but is currently disabled in ISR.

+ Needs to support mode where more specific vectors are generated.
