Configuration Table Use
=======================

sDeviceName

   The name of this device.

deviceType

   This field must be SERIAL_Z85C30.

pDeviceFns

   The device interface control table.  This may be:
      + z85c30_fns for interrupt driven IO
      + z85c30_fns_polled for polled IO

deviceProbe

   This is the address of the routine which probes to see if the device
   is present.

pDeviceFlow

   This field is set to one of the following values:
      + NULL for no hardware flow control
      + z85c30_flow_RTSCTS for RTS/CTS based flow control
      + z85c30_flow_DTRCTS for DTR/CTS based flow control

ulMargin

    This is currently unused.

ulHysteresis

    This is currently unused.

pDeviceParams

    This is set to the default settings.

ulCtrlPort1

   This field is the address of the control register for this port.

ulCtrlPort2

   This field is the address of the control register for chip.

ulDataPort

   This field is the address of the data register for this port.

getRegister
setRegister

   These follow standard conventions.

getData
setData

   These follow standard conventions.

ulClock

   This is the clock speed of the baud rate clock.
   NULL, then the CSR/ACR/X bit mappings shown in the 68681 and 88681
   manuals are used.  Otherwise, the board specific baud rate mapping
   is used.

ulIntVector

   This is the interrupt vector number associated with this chip.
