General
=======

+ It would be nice to utilize the interrupt capabilities of some
  RTC parts.  This could be used to trigger checking the software
  clock against the hardware clock.

+ The periodic capability of most RTCs is not suitable for use
  as a general purpose flexible clock tick source.  For example,
  many RTCs generate only a handful of periods with 100 Hz being the
  most frequent. 

+ The tick field is not set on get.  Anything smaller than a second
  is ignored on set and get operations.

+ Day of week is ignored since RTEMS does not set it internally.

+ There is no attempt in RTEMS to know about time zones.
